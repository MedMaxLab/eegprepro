# How to replicate the experiment

Prepare all the data and run such a high number of training is very time demanding.
However, we believe that replicability and transparency are very important aspects
of deep learning research.
Therefore, this folder includes some markdown files that will explain in detail
all the steps necessary to reproduce the results presented in our paper.

In particular we will cover the following aspect:

1. Environment preparation.
2. Dataset download, preprocessing, and conversion to pickle
3. Run all training
4. Produce figures
